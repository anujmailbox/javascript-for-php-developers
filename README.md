### Tuts+ Course: JavaScript for PHP Developers
#### Instructor: Jason Rhodes

In this course I explain the basics and some common advanced pitfalls of JavaScript, framed in a way that will make sense to intermediate to advanced PHP developers. If you know PHP, need to use JavaScript, but can't make sense of it, this course will walk you through converting a small Slim PHP app into a similar JS app so you can see how the concepts relate.
